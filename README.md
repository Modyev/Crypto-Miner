## Bitcoin Crypto Mining Algorithm Stimulation

This is a simple **Bitcoin like CPU Mining Algorithm Stimulation** made in **C#**. The program simulates the Proof-of-Work (PoW) mining by finding a valid hash with a specified difficulty taken as input from user

**This project was made to stimulate the Bitcoin Mining PoW Algorithm**, This should not be used for real mining as it will be extremely inefficient compared to an ASIC Miner

## How It Works
- It uses the same algorithm used by real miners to Compute and Validate hashes
- Uses **double SHA-256 hashing** to simulate Bitcoin block mining
- Adjusts mining difficulty (number of leading zeros) based on user input
